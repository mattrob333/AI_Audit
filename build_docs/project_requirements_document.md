# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

NextMethod.ai aims to revolutionize how mid-to-large business-to-business (B2B) enterprises approach artificial intelligence (AI) adoption. The platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools designed to assess an organization's readiness for AI, automate specific processes, and deliver customized upskill training. The primary purpose of NextMethod.ai is to help organizations identify and bridge skill gaps, ensuring they're well-prepared to integrate AI into their workflows effectively and securely.

This platform is being developed to address a range of challenges that enterprise clients currently face, such as manual and time-consuming processes, fragmented software ecosystems, and compliance concerns in regulated industries. By offering targeted AI readiness audits and personalized training plans, NextMethod.ai aims to unlock AI's full potential for enterprises while offering a clear roadmap for successful implementation. The key success criteria include achieving measurable improvements in AI adoption, providing actionable insights through analytics, and integrating smoothly with existing enterprise software ecosystems.

## In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

- User Accounts & Roles: Secure, role-based access control with administrative dashboards and fine-grained permissions.
- Real-Time Readiness & Analytics: Dashboards providing AI readiness scores and skill gap analysis.
- Automated Compliance & Readiness Checks: Systematic reviews for industry-specific compliance and software analysis.
- Reporting & Exports: Export data on skills, processes, and recommendations in formats like CSV or PDF.
- Software Integrations: Connect with common tools such as Salesforce, Jira, Slack, and more.
- AI-driven Skill Gap Analysis: Generate customized training documents and AI recommendations.

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Mobile app development for offline access (planned for future phases).
- Integration with niche or non-mainstream software tools beyond initial list.
- Advanced AI features beyond initial automation and skill assessments.
- Offline capabilities or caching beyond reading documents.

## User Flow

A new user first encounters a step-by-step onboarding wizard on NextMethod.ai. This wizard guides them through inputting essential business, team, and software information. Once filled, the system automatically generates an AI readiness score and highlights key areas requiring improvement. Users then receive a personalized checklist of training modules and AI integrations to focus on, helping them track and measure progress effectively.

Upon completing onboarding, users land on a dashboard featuring their organization's current AI maturity level. The left sidebar provides seamless navigation through various sections, including skill gap analysis, compliance checks, and recommended automation opportunities. As users interact with these features, they receive real-time feedback and analytics, empowering them to make informed decisions on their AI journey.

## Core Features

- **Secure User Accounts & Roles**: Role-based access with dashboards for different stakeholders.
- **Real-Time Readiness & Analytics**: Dashboards showing readiness scores and skill gaps.
- **Automated AI Readiness & Compliance Checks**: System reviews for data, industry constraints, and potential compliance issues.
- **Built-In Reporting & Exports**: Data exports and executive summaries in multiple formats.
- **Integration with Common Software Tools**: Connectors for Salesforce, Jira, Slack, etc.
- **AI-Driven Skill Gap Analysis & Upskill Recommendations**: Tailored training content and seminars, custom AI assistant options.

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS for styling, shadcn/UI, Radix UI, and Lucide Icons for UX design.
- **Backend & Storage**: Supabase for database management, authentication, and file storage.
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet models for generating content and AI-based recommendations.
- **IDE & Plugins**: Windsurf for modern IDE capabilities; V0 by Vercel for frontend component building.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure fast load times and efficient data processing.
- **Security**: Robust security measures including encryption and role-based access controls.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to industry standards like GDPR and HIPAA where applicable.
- **Usability**: User-friendly experience with intuitive interfaces and guidance through workflows.

## Constraints & Assumptions

- Dependency on GPT-4o or Claude availability for AI features.
- Assumption that enterprise clients use at least one of the initial integration tools (Salesforce, Slack, etc.).
- Performance metrics are based on real usage data, not fabricated.

## Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Rate Limits**: Anticipate and manage potential restrictions on integrated services.
- **Platform Restrictions**: Be aware of challenges integrating with less common tools or custom solutions.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Ensure regular security audits to detect and patch vulnerabilities.
